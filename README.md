##  Laravel 11 Boilerplate

An easy starter project for Laravel.

- Laravel 11
- LiveWire
- Tailwind
- ViteJs
- AlpineJS
- Powergrid

Todo: 
- Mary UI https://mary-ui.com/
- Some example forms
- File Upload and Handling
- Rest API Resources
- Queue Management
- Integration testing with PEST

And finally Blade UI(*) for components. 
* I will give a try with Mary UI instead of Blade UI
